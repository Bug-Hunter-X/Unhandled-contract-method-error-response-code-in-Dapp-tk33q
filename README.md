This bug demonstrates an issue in a Dapp's error handling. When making calls to contract methods, the dapp may receive unexpected response codes.  The current code lacks proper error handling to provide informative messages to the user, leading to poor UX.  The solution provides enhanced error handling that provides user-friendly messages based on various error codes.
